# Terraform Azure Infrastructure Management

## Overview
This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. It uses Terraform to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, networks, and more.

Additionally, it leverages GitHub Actions for automating Terraform workflows, enabling continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes for managing the infrastructure.
